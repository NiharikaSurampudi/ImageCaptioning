# ImageCaptioning
Image Captioning project using ResNet50  & InceptionV3.
Here the task is to predict captions for a given image using Deep Learning Models.
We made a comparison between two CNN architectures which are InceptionV3 and ResNet50.
In comparing CNN architectures for image captioning, ResNet50 outperformed InceptionV3 in generating accurate test image captions. ResNet50's deeper network and skip connections enabled better feature extraction and context understanding. Consequently, it provided more precise and relevant descriptions for the test images.
